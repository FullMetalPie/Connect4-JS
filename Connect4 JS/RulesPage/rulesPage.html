            <span class="bigText">1. Game setup:</span><br />
            The game is played on a 6x7 grid (6 rows and 7 columns). <br />
            Each player chooses a color (usually red or yellow) and
             takes turns placing one of their colored discs into any
              of the empty columns.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
            <span class="bigText">2. Taking Turns:</span><br />
            Players take turns placing one of their discs into any 
            open column from the top.<br />
            Once a disc is dropped into a column, it occupies the 
            lowest available space in that column.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
            <span class="bigText">3. Connecting Four</span><br />
            The objective is to be the first player to connect four of their own discs in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally).<br />
            The connection can be made in any direction (left, right, up, down, or diagonally).
